**TOTAL TIME**

25 minutes
**Servings:** 7

## Ingredients
- 1 cup (240 ml) unsweetened PLAIN almond milk
- 1 Tbsp (15 ml) fresh lemon juice
- 2 cups (272 g) unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp (7 g) baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 3/4 tsp sea salt
- 4 Tbsp (56 g) non-dairy, unsalted butter (I use Earth Balance)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C), and add lemon 
juice to almond milk to make "vegan buttermilk." Set aside.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.
3. Add cold butter and use fingers or a pastry cutter to 
combine the two until only small pieces remain and it looks 
like sand. Work quickly so the butter doesn’t get too warm.
4. Make a well in the dry ingredients and, using a wooden 
spoon, stir gently while pouring in the almond milk mixture 
1/4 cup at a time. You may not need all of it. Stir until just 
slightly combined – it will be sticky.
5. Turn onto a lightly floured surface, dust the top with 
a bit of flour and then very gently turn the dough over on 
itself 5-6 times – hardly kneading.
6. Form into a 1-inch thick disc, handling as little as possible.
7. Use a 1-inch thick dough cutter or a similar-shape object 
with sharp edges (such as a cocktail shaker) and push straight 
down through the dough, then slightly twist. Repeat and place 
biscuits on a baking sheet in two rows, making sure they just 
touch – this will help them rise uniformly. Gently reform the 
dough and cut out one or two more biscuits – you should have 7-8.
8. Next brush the tops with a bit more of melted non-dairy butter 
and gently press a small divot in the center using two fingers. 
This will also help them rise evenly, so the middle won’t form a dome.
9. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until fluffy and slightly golden 
brown. Serve immediately. Let remaining biscuits cool completely 
before storing them in an airtight container or bag.
